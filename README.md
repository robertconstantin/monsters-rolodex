# CAT MATCHER

Find the cat that you love the most

## The problem

There are in between 15 and 73 cat breeds in the world, so finding the one for a cat lover, it might be a difficult task. This app it is a first step to solve this problem. In order to keep the user entertained to tackle this difficult task, we came up with the idea of Tinder like cat matcher.

## The proposed solution

A user will start with 10 random cats and it will swipe until no more it's left. He can swipe either left if he doesn't like the cat, or right if he loves it. The algorithm behind it will find the most liked breed of cat that the user swiped right (liked ones). If it has more than 2 likes on that breed, it will show that breed as the matched one. Once the initial 10 cats are swiped, additional 10 cats will be loaded for the user.

## Future versions

Future versions might include machine learning in order to determine the most liked breed. I might also include additional information for the matched breed, also a list with previeously liked cats.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
